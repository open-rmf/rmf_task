## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

Each feature in `rmf_task` has corresponding tests which simulate typical usage.
They are located in the [`test`](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_task/tree/main/rmf_task/test) directory.
New features are required to have tests before being added.

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

Each part of the public API has tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added.
They are located in the [`test`](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_task/tree/main/rmf_task/test) directory.

### Coverage [4.iii]

`rmf_task` tracks code coverage statistics.
There is no coverage target currently, but new changes are required to make a best effort to keep or increase coverage before being accepted.
Decreases are allowed if properly justified and accepted by reviewers.
Code coverage will be improved in the future as time allows.

Current coverage statistics can be viewed [here](https://codecov.io/gh/open-rmf/rmf_task).

### Performance [4.iv]

`rmf_task` does not test performance.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`rmf_task` does not use the standard linters and static analysis tools for its CMake code to ensure it follows the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#linters).

`rmf_task` uses a custom `uncrustify` configuration matching its coding style.
